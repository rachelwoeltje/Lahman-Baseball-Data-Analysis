/* Q13
It is thought that since left-handed pitchers are more rare, 
causing batters to face them less often, that they are more effective. 
Investigate this claim and present evidence to either support or dispute this claim. 
First, determine just how rare left-handed pitchers are compared with right-handed pitchers. 
Are left-handed pitchers more likely to win the Cy Young Award? 
Are they more likely to make it into the hall of fame? */

/* Conclusions: 
It's a right handed world out there! 
Out of 9082 recorded pitchers all time, 72% are right handed
Out of 77 Cy Young Award winners, 68.82% are right handed
Out of 101 pitchers in the HOF, 77.23% are right handed
With only .15 difference in opponent batting avg (avg) and 
.08 difference in era (avg) Between LHP and RHP, 
there does not seem to be a significant difference in batter success
when facing either LHP or RHP despite there being far more RHP than LHP */
