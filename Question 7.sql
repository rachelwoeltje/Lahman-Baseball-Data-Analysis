/* Q7
From 1970 – 2016, what is the largest number of wins 
for a team that did not win the world series? */
SELECT NAME, yearid, w, wswin
FROM teams
WHERE yearid BETWEEN 1970 AND 2016
AND wswin = 'N'
ORDER BY w DESC
--ANSWER: The largest number of wins for a team that didn't win the world series were the Mariners in 2001 (116 wins)

/* What is the smallest number of wins for a team that did win the world series? 
Doing this will probably result in an unusually small 
number of wins for a world series champion – determine why this is the case. 
Then redo your query, excluding the problem year. */
SELECT NAME yearid, w, wswin
FROM teams
WHERE yearid BETWEEN 1970 AND 2016
AND wswin = 'Y'
ORDER BY w ASC
--ANSWER: The smallest number of wins for a team winning the world series were the Dodgers in 1981 (63 wins)
--ANSWER: This unusually low number of wins was due to the players strike in 1981 that split the season in half

--Then redo your query, excluding the problem year. 
SELECT NAME, yearid, w, wswin
FROM teams
WHERE yearid BETWEEN 1970 AND 2016
AND wswin = 'Y'
AND yearid <> 1981
ORDER BY w ASC
--ANSWER: Excluding the year 1981, the world series winning team with the lowest amount of wins were the Cardinals in 2006 (83 wins)

/* How often from 1970 – 2016 was it the case that a team 
with the most wins also won the world series? What percentage of the time?
